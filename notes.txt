1. Typescript basics
    The core primitive types in TypeScript
        number 1,5.3
        string "HI"
        boolean true false
    Object types
        object { age: 30 }
    Array types
        array [1,2,3]
    // doestnot have in js
    Tuple
      [1,2] fixed length array,  role: [number, string];
    Enum
      enum { NEW, OLD}
      enum Role {
            ADMIN = 'test',
            READ_ONLY,
       }
    Any
    union
         num1: number | string
    literal types
    type alias
        type Combine = number | string;
    void functions
        if function doesnot return we have to add void as type
    unknown types

2. Compiler and configuration deep dive
3. working with next gen js code
4. classes interfaces
   Objects 
    thie things you work with in code
    Instaces of classes (=based on clasees)
   Classes
    Blue print of Objects
    Define how objects look like, which properties and methods they have
    classes make creation of multiple similar objects much easier
5. advanced types ts features
    [private, public, readonly, protected,static]
    private can't access outside of class scope
    public keys can access from anywhere in class 
    readOnly
    protected key variable can be used in inherited classes same as private key but can be used in other classes
6. generics 
7. decorators
8. full projects
9. working with namespaces and modules
10. webpack and ts
11. third party libs 
12. react with ts and node with ts
